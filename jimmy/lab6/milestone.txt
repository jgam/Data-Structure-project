1. Basic structure(10pts)
	a. Board-int board[8][8]
	b. Pieces - we must have the pieces defined somehow so that we can 
	recognize them
	-Everything else depands on the existence fo those two parts
	-we need a const array to hold the starting position of a chess 
	game. and we call them by names rather than calling them with 
	values.
	-a function that sets up the board of the start of a game
	-Important! we need an input info from the user with function 
	getline().
2. Piece move generation(10pts)
	a.need an array(we need four containers for each move)
	b. index the movements with z to follow up how many moves that 
	players have made
	-each pieces have their unique movements and note that it is 
	important to use break; after each case, because it would start 
	generating moves for the last piece found as something it isn't.
3. Gamefunctions(20pts)
	a.checkmate
	-it is assumed that the AI will play all the way until it is finally 
	checkmated. Therefore, checkmate functgino is important.
	-the concept of function will involve that the final string contains 
	1 move or more the gams is till in progress, we check to see if our 
	king is in check and the nplayer to move is checkmated.
